# State vector simulation of a quantum state

Created with an emphasis on subsystem measurements. Capabilities include application of one and two qubit gates, evolution under a brick-work random circuit, mid-circuit measurements, and computing properties of the state such as entanglement entropy.


## Examples

Currently includes an [example](examples/measurement_induced_transition.ipynb) illustrating the competing effects of evolution under a random quantum circuit and measurements, and an [example](examples/random_circuit_sampling.ipynb) exploring random circuit sampling in brick-work circuits, both with and without noise.


## Updates coming up :

More examples, ~~simulating noise~~ and generalizing everything for qudits.
